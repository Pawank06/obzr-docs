# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating MDX documentation pages for all sidebar navigation items in the AgentOS documentation site. Currently, the sidebar contains 7 main sections with 28 individual documentation pages, but only a single example page exists (hello-world). This feature will generate the complete documentation structure with placeholder content that can be populated later.

## Glossary

- **MDX**: Markdown format that allows embedding JSX components within markdown content
- **Documentation System**: The Next.js-based documentation site located in the `/docs` directory
- **Sidebar Navigation**: The navigation menu defined in `docs/components/docs-sidebar.tsx` containing all documentation links
- **Content Directory**: The `docs/content/docs/` folder where MDX files are stored
- **Page Route**: The Next.js app router page component in `docs/app/docs/` that renders the MDX content
- **DocsFeedback Component**: The feedback widget component displayed at the bottom of documentation pages

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want all sidebar navigation items to have corresponding MDX files, so that the documentation structure is complete and ready for content population.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Documentation System is built, THE Documentation System SHALL create MDX files for all 28 documentation pages listed in the sidebar navigation
2. THE Documentation System SHALL organize MDX files in the Content Directory using a folder structure that mirrors the URL paths defined in the Sidebar Navigation
3. THE Documentation System SHALL ensure each MDX file contains a basic template with a title, introduction placeholder, and section structure
4. THE Documentation System SHALL name each MDX file using kebab-case format matching the URL slug from the Sidebar Navigation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a documentation reader, I want each documentation page to render properly with consistent layout, so that I have a uniform reading experience across all pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a documentation URL is accessed, THE Documentation System SHALL render the corresponding MDX content within the docs layout
2. THE Documentation System SHALL create Next.js Page Route components for each documentation page that imports and displays the corresponding MDX file
3. THE Documentation System SHALL include the DocsFeedback Component at the bottom of each rendered documentation page
4. THE Documentation System SHALL apply consistent prose styling to all MDX content using Tailwind typography classes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MDX files to follow a consistent structure, so that content can be easily added and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL include a level-1 heading in each MDX file that matches the page title from the Sidebar Navigation
2. THE Documentation System SHALL include placeholder sections for Overview, Key Features, and Usage in each MDX file
3. THE Documentation System SHALL use semantic heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) within each MDX file
4. THE Documentation System SHALL include placeholder code examples in MDX files for SDK and API reference pages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want the file structure to be organized logically, so that I can easily locate and update specific documentation pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL create nested folders in the Content Directory matching the URL structure (e.g., `docs/content/docs/sdk/memory-system.mdx`)
2. THE Documentation System SHALL create corresponding nested folders in the Page Route directory (e.g., `docs/app/docs/sdk/memory-system/page.tsx`)
3. THE Documentation System SHALL maintain the existing docs layout component without modification
4. THE Documentation System SHALL preserve the existing hello-world example page structure as a reference
